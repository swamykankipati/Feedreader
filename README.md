## Steps to implement the Project

-   Downloaded the project git-hub repository.(<https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader>)
-   Extract the Zip file
-   opened index.html file analysed all the classes,elements and their puropse.

## Evaluated all the test cases,that is available in feedreader.js file,i.e shown as below:

   Testcase-1: test to make sure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty.
     Initially  Test case 'are defined' for  Test Suit 'RSS Feeds' .

   Testcase-2: test case 'url is defined or not' by using while loop  for Test Suite 'RSS Feeds'.
              Evaluated test case 'url defined' by using do-while loop for Test Suite 'RSS Feeds'.

   Testcase-3: ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
         Evaluated test case 'name defined' by using do-while loop for Test Suite 'RSS Feeds'.

   Testcase-4: Evaluated test case 'hidden by default' for test suite 'The menu'.

   Testcase-5: Evaluated test case 'menu visibility' for test suite 'The menu'. This test case will work when we clicked on menu button, It will show the menu list. Again when we clicked on it menu list will hide.

   Testcase-6: Evaluated test case 'entry element ' for test Suite 'Initial Entries'.

   Testcase-7:  test suite 'New Feed Selection' with test case 'if feeds are different'.This will check difference between oldfeed and testfeed url changed or not.
